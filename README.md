hi! Ok, not the way to start this... This is a custom made discord bot. And i know, you are really exited to use this but here are some rules and limitations... I have made this myself for my own discord server and wanted to give some examples or even give you a template but there are some things that should be change like some of the responses. I am completly ok if you make some changes but here are some non negotiables. you cannot change the "watermark" by any means. The boot responce and the info responce does include our copyright and company as well as other important info. DO NOT CHANGE THE COPYRIGHT OR VERSION NUMBER!! Speaking of version... the posted code on here works (hopefully) and will update regularly as we make changes and improve the system. The version can also be found in the info section and will be in the notes of the github page. anothe r important note is that this code is not allowed to be used unless specific permission is given by me. contact me if you want to use this so we can go over some general things before we get started. And the most important thing, WE DO NOT HOST THIS CODE! Your bot will require a hosting software and we do not provide that. We can give you tips on how to host it but we will not host it for you. and that should be all. more info comming soon and i hope you enjoy the bot. (version listed on code file) AP(c) 2025
